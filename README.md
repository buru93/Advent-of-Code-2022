# Advent-of-Code-2022
Challenges from website Advent of Code 2022. On this repo I will post the source code that allow me to get the final result.
For each daily statment I will have two files, one named with the day challenge and the other one as input and the day number. Here an example 'day1' and 'input_day1'.

All challenge statement are obtained from https://adventofcode.com/ and they're awesome webpage.
